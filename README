prototype-tables is a Prototype-based document generation class that allows for
creation of documents. Obviously.

prototype-tables was built for Prototype 1.5.1 but may work with newer versions,
I don't know. I haven't touched Prototype in 3 years since I built this back in
2007 for a work-related project at an old job. I don't even know if this code
even works, however I vaugely remember it *only* working in Firefox 2.

You're more than welcome to do whatever you want with this, only putting it in
GitHub because I don't want to delete it off my backups and I was fairly proud
of myself and my early JS skills when I wrote it; so basically a long winded
version of "shits and giggles".

That said, here's an example on how to use it:
  new prototypeTables('div', {
    attributes: {'id': 'myfirstdiv'},
    styles: {'background-color': '#66FFCC', 'padding': '5px'},
    classes: ['firstclass', 'secondclass'],
    add_text: 'Here is an example div.'
  }, 'myparent');
